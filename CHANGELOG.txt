CHANGELOG for Visibility, by Jeff Geerling

ROADMAP / FUTURE ADDITIONS:
 - Ability to save preference to toggle file visibility on App open.
 - Feature to simply allow user to 'Open Invisible File...' (instead of showing all invisible files)
 - Ability to run Visibility as a menu bar service (without app running)

KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS:
 - Sometimes, Finder won't fully restart after hiding invisible files.
 - Activity indicator (spinner) is set to spin for 5 seconds, then stop (no matter what).

VERSIONS:

1.0.1
 - Added menu items in Dock icon to allow file visibility change there.
 - New App icon (more in conformance with Apple's HID guidelines for icons).

1.0.0
 - Initial version of Visibility, submitted to Mac App Store in Jan. '11.
