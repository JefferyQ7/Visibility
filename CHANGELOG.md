# CHANGELOG for Visibility, by Jeff Geerling

# ROADMAP / FUTURE ADDITIONS:
 
  - Ability to save preference to toggle file visibility on App open.
  - Feature to simply allow user to 'Open Invisible File...' (instead of showing all invisible files)
  - Ability to run Visibility as a menu bar service (without app running)

# KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS:
 
  - There are no known bugs at this time.

# VERSIONS

## 1.0.1

  - Process of showing/hiding files now uses NSTask instead of system() (for more reliablity).
  - Fixed issues with restarting Finder in Mac OS X 10.8.
  - Added menu items in Dock icon to allow file visibility change there.
  - New App icon (more in conformance with Apple's HID guidelines for icons).

## 1.0.0

  - Initial version of Visibility, submitted to Mac App Store in Jan. '11.
